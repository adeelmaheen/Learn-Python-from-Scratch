# following are some comman operators in python: 
# Arithemetic Operators:  + , - , * , /  etc
# Assignment Operators: = , += , -= , etc
# Comparison Operators: == , > , < , >= , <= , != etc
# Logical Operators: and, or, not

# Arithemetic Operators:
 
# a = 7 + 3 = 10
#   7 and 3 are operands 
#  + are operator 
#  10 is result

a = 34
b = 4
c = a + b 
print(c)

# Assignment Operators: 
d = 4 - 2
print(d)
e = 6
e += 4  # increment the value of e by 4 and then assign it to e
print(e)


# Comparision Operator: 

_compare = 5 > 4
print(_compare)

# Answer return in boolean value always
_again_comapre = 5!=5
print(_again_comapre)

# == double equal is always check for equality
#  = single equal is alwys assignn the value.

num1 = 5 == 5
print(num1)


# Logical Operatore:
# or, and , not
# "or" always find a single true in the statement.
# "and" always check both side are equal statement
# "not" negoiate the value means reverse the output
