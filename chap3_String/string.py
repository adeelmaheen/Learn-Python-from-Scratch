# String
# string is a data type in python
# string is a sequence of a characters enclosed in quotes.
# we can primarily write a string in these three ways.

a = "Maheen"            # single quote string
b = 'Maheen'            # double quote string
c = ''' Maheen '''      # triple quote string

# String Slicing
# A string in python can be sliced for getting a part of the strings.
# string is in immutable we cant change the character of a string later
# Consider the following string:

Name   = " M A H E E N "        # string characters
index  = " 0 1 2 3 4 5 "        # index start with 0
length = " 1 2 3 4 5 6 "        # length start with 1
