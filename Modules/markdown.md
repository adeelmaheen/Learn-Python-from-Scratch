# Modules and pip in Python

 when ever we write code in python there's two way to write a code 
 1- Built in modules 
 2- External modules

 Built in modules: these modules are ready to import and use with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
 External modules:  these modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is wriiten by someonealse, we can install different versions od a same moduleswith time.
 
## The pip command 
it can be used as a pakage manger pip to install a python modules. Lets install a module called pandas using the following command 

#pip 
pip is the package  manager for python. you can use pip to install a module on your system.
